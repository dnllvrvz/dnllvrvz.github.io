description: "In this project I was a *professor* in a meta-MOOC on how to learn online. The course was especially designed for newcomers in Germany, with a focus on how they can get the most out of online learning experiences. And, thus, best utilize [Kiron](https://kiron.ngo/)'s services."

During a large part of my childhood, I built and fixed computers around my neighborhood. By breaking and fixing mine and my friend's computers, I learned quite a lot about dealing with hardware. My master piece of computer building still exists and is fully operational.

Here's the [website](https://sites.google.com/site/pconcertos/) I put online to market my work, which I now realized was also the first website I developed. Unfortunately, it didn't bring me any extra work. Perhaps that is because of the misspelling in the word "conserto" (fix).
