<h2>It's hard to tell a nonlinear story in a linear way</h2>

<p>I feel that when we talk about ourselves, we do it in a very
linear fashion, which is part a byproduct of the mediums we use <i>(you have been reading
this text from left-to-right in a up-to-down screen isn't?)</i>. My opinion
is that this brings some challenges when we try to communicate the complexities
of our lives. At least that's something I feel when I try to talk about myself.</p>

<p>Challenge acknowledged, here I'll try to share a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will shed light onto questions such as
<b>"What do you do?", "What have you studied?", "Where do you work?"</b>, etc.</p>

<h2>Last Resume</h2>

<p>When I worked on my previous portfolio, I created a simple interactive
widget/app on R to display some of my previous academic and work experiences.</p>

<center><small><i><p>Drag and scroll for perspective. Hover items for more information.</p></i></small></center>

<p>Here we have information about my schooling, work and where I have been in the world
<b>from 2013 until early 2018</b>. After that, the level of complexity of the things I do have
increased greatly, so I stopped trying to linearize them.</p>

---

<h2>Mapping nonlinearity</h2>

<p>When I had to present myself in <b>late 2018</b>, I found a good way to visually
communicate more of said complexity through a map of the things I had been doing until then.
For that, I built on top of a beautiful piece of art by artist <a href="http://www.mellolandini.com/">Janaina Mello Landini</a>:</p>

![MapCV](/assets/images/mapcv.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">The map is not the territory. Inspired by CICLOTRAMA 114 (vento)</figcaption>

<p>I tried to create a sense of how the things I have been doing lately are
interconnected and feedback into each other. This representation does not hold
the details of the activities I performed, but it does map well how things
developed until that point.</p>

---

<h2>"But what can you actually do?"</h2>

<p>I believe <b>proficiency is mostly contextual</b>. Meaning that, given the
appropriate context (time, motivation, access, etc), most things can be performed
by almost anyone. Personally, this is not to say I can perform everything,
but I do try to nurture a polymath spirit.</p>

<h3>From Patterns</h3>

<p>There are patterns that characterize my performance:</P>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Experimentation is a default approach</li>
	<li>Interaction and communication are important</li>
	<li>Autonomy is very much appreciated</li>
	<li>Activities are taken as processes</li>
	<li>I dislike work poorly done</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Details</h3>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>I can create and sustain the field for group interactions and dynamics</li>
	 	<ul><li><small><i>Call it Emergent Facilitation</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I can give life to different types of content</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>From writing/filming/interviewing, to editing, to animating</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I can perform Research</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>I'm well versed in the scientific method</i></small></li>
		<li><small><i>Striving to live a qualitative empirically life</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I am familiar with Web-development, Python, R, and Netlogo</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>Copy & paste approach</i></small></li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>To Examples</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://dnllvrvz.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> section of this website
to see some examples what I described above. I'd be happy to provide more information. The <a href="https://dnllvrvz.github.io/tags/">Tags page</a> can be helpful too.</p>

<h2>Initial Conditions</h2>

<center><small><p><i>What is more nonlinear than concluding with the beginning?</i></p></small></center>

<p>My adventure in this planet began in the periphery of one of the largest peripheral cities of São Paulo, Brazil. Growing up in the creative caos of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=carapicu%C3%ADba#map=13/-23.5473/-46.8452">Carapicuíba</a>, I learned a great
deal about self-organization and complexity long before hearing about such concepts.</p>

<p>Up until high school, I attended the Brazilian public educational system, which is, unfortunately,
one of the worst in the world. Nonetheless, by the age of 15, I was lucky and competent enough to join <a href="http://www.sidarta.org.br/colegio/pt/">Sidarta</a> - one of the best private schools in the country - with a full scholarship granted by the <a href="https://www.ismart.org.br/">ISMART</a> NGO. This marked
the beginning of a deep transformation in my life, bringing me access and opportunities never
seen in the history of my family.</p>

<p>From then on, I kept on learning and growing through educational scholarships and grants. And I can't help being very proud of them, so I think they deserve to be here as well:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2010: ISMART high school scholarship for low-income student</li>
	<li>2013: English studies scholarship at Cultura Inglesa</li>
	<li>2014: Partial tuition scholarship for Preparing Global Leaders Academy - Jordan</li>
	<ul><li><small><i>Remaining $1800 raised through an <a href="https://www.kickante.com.br/campanhas/danilo-na-pgla-jordania">online crowdfunding campaign</a></i></small></li></ul>
	<li>2014: Research scholarship at São Paulo State University</li>
	<li>2015/16: Full tuition & boarding scholarship at <a href="https://minerva.kgi.edu">Minerva Schools at KGI</a></li>
	<ul><li><small><i>Renewed for 2016/17</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>2015/: AB-Inbev grant for Brazilian students in the USA</li>
	<ul><li><small><i>Renewed for 2016/17</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>2017: Full scholarship for the Capra Course on "The Systems View of Life"</li>
</ul>

<h2>"Today"</h2>

<p>All this (and more) brings me to "today", where most of my activities are
not intermediated by institutions (call me a free-learner/researcher/practitioner/lancer),
and I try to live out my interests and the theories I study. What this means?
Well, the answers to this question are constantly changing, given that I have
really been engaging with a varied of different activities, travels, studies, and so on.</p>

<h3>Reference</h3>

<p>I think that this informal "reference" from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bbdc3vkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Michael Zargham</a> exemplifies what I'm trying to say:</p>
