During a large part of my childhood, I built and fixed computers around my neighborhood. By breaking and fixing mine and my friend's computers, I learned quite a lot about dealing with hardware. I was playing the Maker before I knew about this word.

Here's the [website](https://sites.google.com/site/pconcertos/) I put online to market my work, which I now realized was also the first website I developed. Unfortunately, it didn't bring me any extra work. Perhaps that is because of the misspelling in the word "conserto" (fix).
