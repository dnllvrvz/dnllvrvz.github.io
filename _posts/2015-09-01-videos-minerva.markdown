In 2015 and 2016 I worked as a *visual-media-jack-of-all-trades-intern* for my school. It was a fun experience that taught me a lot about professional video-making. In fact, that was when I first learned how to use professional equipment and software. Bellow are some of the works I'm most proud of from this period, including shorts with a traveling chair and a "veggie photo booth".
