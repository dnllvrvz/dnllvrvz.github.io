<h1>Complex Vitae</h1>

<h2>It's hard to tell a nonlinear story in a linear fashion</h2>

<p>I feel that, usually, when we talk about ourselves, we do it in a very
linear fashion, starting from the mediums we use <i>(you have been reading
this text from left-to-right in a up-to-down screen isn't?)</i>. My opinion
is that this poses some challenges for us to communicate the complexities
of our lives. At least that's something I feel when I try to talk about myself.</p>

<p>Even so, I think sometimes I do a good job at that, like in the video below</p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgK8QFYdbNk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Challenge acknowledged, here I'll strive to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will shed light on questions such as
**"What do you do?"**, **"Where have you studied?"**, **"Where do you work?"**, etc.</p>

<h2>Last Resume</h2>

<p>When I worked on my previous portfolio, I created a simple interactive
widget/app on R to display some of my previous academic and work experiences.</p>

<p>Here we have information about my schooling, work and where I lived in the world
from 2013 until early 2018. After that, the level of complexity of the things I do have
increased greatly, so I stopped trying to linearize them.</p>

<h2>Mapping nonlinearity</h2>

<p>When I had to present myself in late 2018, I came up with a good way to visually
communicate more of said complexity, through a mapping of the things I had been doing by then.
For that, I had the help of a beautiful piece of art by artist <a href="http://www.mellolandini.com/">Janaina Mello Landini</a>:</p>

![MapCV](/assets/images/mapcv.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">"The map is not the territory". Inspirado em CICLOTRAMA 114 (vento)"</figcaption>

Here, I tried to create a sense
of how the things I have been doing lately are connected and feedback into each other.
This representation does not hold the details of the activities I performed,
but it does map well how things developed until late 2018.</p>

<h2>"But what can you actually do?"</h2>

<p>I believe <b>proficiency is mostly contextual</b>. Meaning that, <b>given the
appropriate context (time, motivation, etc),</b> most things can be performed.
This is not to say I can perform anything, but I do try to be a polymath.</p>

<h3>From Patterns</h3>

<p>There are patterns that characterize my performance:</P>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Experimentation and Co-creation are main approaches</li>
	<li>Open interaction and communication are key</li>
	<li>Uncertainty does not bring discomfort</li>
	<li>Autonomy is very much appreciated</li>
	<li>Activities are taken as processes</li>
	<li>Goals are contextual, thus dynamic</li>
	<li>I learn and refine as I go</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Details</h3>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>I can create and sustain the field for group conversations and projects</li>
	 	<ul><li><small><i>Call it Emergent Consulting</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I can give life to different types of content</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>From writing/filming/interviewing, to editing, to animating</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I can perform Research</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>Well versed in the scientific method</i></small></li>
		<li><small><i>Striving to live a qualitative empirically life</i></small></li></ul>
	<li>I can do basic WebDev/Design, Python, R, and Netlogo</li>
		<ul><li><small><i>Open source copy and paste approach</i></small></li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>To Examples</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://dnllvrvz.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> section of this website
to see some examples of what I am describing above. The <a href="https://dnllvrvz.github.io/tags/">Tags page</a> can also be helpful for that.

<h2>Lastly, Initial Conditions</h2>

<p><small><i>What is more nonlinear than finishing with the beginning?</i></small></p>

<p>My story in this planet starts in one of the largest peripheral cities of São Paulo, Brazil.
Growing up in the beautiful and creative caos of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=carapicu%C3%ADba#map=13/-23.5473/-46.8452">Carapicuíba</a>, I learned a great
deal about self-organization and complexity long before hearing about such concepts.</p>

<p>By the age of 15, I was lucky (and competent?) enough to attend <a href="http://www.sidarta.org.br/colegio/pt/">Sidarta</a> - one of the best private schools in the country - with a fully paid scholarship through the NGO <a href="https://www.ismart.org.br/">ISMART</a>, breaking many cycles in the history of my family and marking a new phase of my journey.</p>

<p>From then on, I kept on learning and growing through scholarships. I can't help being very proud of them,
so I think they deserve to be here as well:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ISMART scholarship for low-income high-school student</li>
	<li>Scholarship for English education at Cultura Inglesa</li>
	<li>Partial scholarship for Preparing Global Leaders Academy - Jordan</li>
	<ul><li><small><i>Remaining +$1800 raised through an <a href="https://www.kickante.com.br/campanhas/danilo-na-pgla-jordania">online crowdfunding campaign</a></i></small></li></ul>
	<li>Research scholarship at São Paulo State University</li>
	<li>Full tuition & boarding scholarship at Minerva Schools at KGI</li>
	<li>AB-Inbev scholarship for Brazilian students abroad</li>
	<li>Full scholarship for Capra Course attendance</li>
</ul>

<h2>"Today"</h2>

<p>All this (and more) brings me to "today", where most of my activities are
not intermediated by institutions (call me a free learner/practitioner) and I have
the means to try to live out my interests and the theories I study. What this means?
Luckily, the answers to this are constantly changing. So I think we will need to have a chat?</p>
