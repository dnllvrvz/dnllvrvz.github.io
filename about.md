<h1>Complex Vitae</h1>

<h2>It's hard to tell a nonlinear story in a linear fashion</h2>

<p>I feel that, usually, when we talk about ourselves, we do it in a very
linear fashion, starting from the mediums we use <i>(you have been reading
this text from left-to-right in a up-to-down screen isn't?)</i>. My opinion
is that this poses some challenges for us to communicate the complexities
of our lives. At least that's something I feel when I try to talk about myself.</p>

<p>Even so, I think sometimes I do a good job at that, like in the video below
<small>(slip tedx talk in cv âœ”):</small></p>

<p>Challenge acknowledged, here I'll strive to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will shed light on questions such as
"What do you do?", "Where have you studied?", "Where do you work?", etc.</p>

<h2>Last Resume</h2>

<p>When I worked on my previous portfolio, I created a simple interactive
widget/app on R to display some of my previous academic and work experiences.</p>

<center><small><i>Drag and scroll for perspective. Hover items for more information.</i></small></center>

</iframe></center>

<p>Here we have information about my schooling, work and where I lived in the world
from 2013 until early 2018. After that, the level of complexity of the things I do have
increased greatly, so I stopped trying to linearize them.</p>

<h2>Mapping nonlinearity</h2>

<p>When I had to present myself in late 2018, I came up with a good way to visually
communicate more of said complexity, through a mapping of the things I had been doing by then.
For that, I had the help of a beautiful piece of art by artist <a href="http://www.mellolandini.com/">Janaina Mello Landini</a>:</p>

![MapCV][/assets/images/mapcv.png]{: class="bigger-image" }

<p><strong>The map is not the territory</strong>. Here, I tried to create a sense
of how the things I have been doing lately are connected and feedback into each other.
This representation does not hold the details of the activities I performed,
but it does map well how things developed until late 2018.</p>

<h2>But what can you actually do?</h2>

<p>I understand that it is expected of any CV to contain a list of skills, crafts, and wizardries,
as well as short descriptions of previous experiences. The truth, however, is that in all of the activities
I partook, I had to learn and exercise a variety of abilities, so it's hard for me to decide which one to list.
Besides, I believe <b>proficiency is mostly contextual</b>, meaning that <b>given the appropriate context (time, motivation, etc)</b> most things can be performed.</p>

<h3>From Patterns</h3>

<h3>To Details</h3>

<h2>Lastly, Initial Conditions</h2>

What is more nonlinear than finishing with the beginning?
