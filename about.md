<h2>It's hard to tell a non-linear story in a linear fashion</h2>

<p>I feel that, usually, when we talk about ourselves, we do it in a very
linear fashion - starting from the mediums we use (you have been reading
this text from left-to-right in a up-to-down screen isn't?). That makes it
challenging for us to explore the possible complexities of that which we do
in life. I feel that when I'm trying to talk about myself. Even so, I think
that sometimes I  manage to make sense, like in the video below</p>

</ul>

<p>Challenge acknowledged, I'll strive here to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will bring clarity to the questions
"What do you do?", "Where have you studied?", "Where do you work?", etc.</p>

<h2>Last Resume Attempt</h2>

<p>When I worked on my previous portifolio in 2017, I created a simple interactive
widget/app on R to talk about some of my previous experiences. Here it is:</p>

<div> style="margin: 45px 0 0 0">
				<center><p><i>Drag and scroll for perspective. Hover for more information.</i></p></center>

<h2>Mapping non-linearity</h2>

<p>Many things changed for me since this last attempt (as I describe below),
increasing the complexity of the things I do/experience. And when I had to present
in 2018, I believe I found a good way to visually
communicate more of said Complexity, through a mapping of the things I have

<p>Challenge acknowledged, I'll strive here to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will bring clarity to the questions
"What do you do?", "Where have you studied?", "Where do you work?", etc.</p>
