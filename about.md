<h1>Complex Vitae</h1>

<h2>It's hard to tell a Non-linear story in a linear fashion</h2>

<p>I feel that, usually, when we talk about ourselves, we do it in a very
linear fashion, starting from the mediums we use <i>(you have been reading
this text from left-to-right in a up-to-down screen isn't?)</i>. My opinion
is that this poses some challenges for us to communicate the complexities
of our lives. At least that's something I feel when I try to talk about myself.</p>

<p>Even so, I think sometimes I do a good job at that, like in the video below:</p>

<ul class="skill-list">

</ul>

<p>Challenge acknowledged, here I'll strive to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will bring clarity to questions such as
"What do you do?", "Where have you studied?", "Where do you work?", etc.</p>

<h2>Last Resume Attempt</h2>

<p>When I worked on my previous portfolio in 2017, I created a simple interactive
widget/app on R to talk about some of my previous academic and work experiences.</p>

<h2>Mapping non-linearity</h2>

<p>Many things changed for me since this last attempt (as I describe below),
increasing the complexity of the things I do/experience. And when I had to present
in 2018, I believe I found a good way to visually
communicate more of said Complexity, through a mapping of the things I have

<p>Challenge acknowledged, I'll strive here to transmit a bit more of said
complexity in my life. And I hope this will bring clarity to the questions
"What do you do?", "Where have you studied?", "Where do you work?", etc.</p>
